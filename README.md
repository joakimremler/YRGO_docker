# Docker

> Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code. -- https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker

## Assignments

## 1. Install docker on Droplet

The first thing you should do is to install Docker on your DigitalOcean Droplet. SSH to your server and follow [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) guide.
You can start to do step 1 and 2.

S:
Update server:

    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

Use let apt-get use HTTPS:

    $ sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Add GPG key:

    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"

Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

    $ sudo apt update

Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:

    $ apt-cache policy docker-ce

Install Docker

    $ sudo apt install docker-ce

Check Status:

    $ sudo systemctl status docker

Add username to sudo group:

    $ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in, or type the following:

    $ su - ${USER}

Confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:

    $ id -nG

## 2. Run a hello-world Container

To continue you can read step 3 and 4 from [DigitalOcean Docker Guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04). Where they explains the Docker concept about image and Containers. When you have read these steps you should now run your first container from a image called [hello-world](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/), but first you need to download the `hello-world` image from dockerhub by [pulling](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) it.

Write this command in the terminal:

    $ docker pull hello-world

Then we should [run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) this image:

    $ docker run hello-world

You should now se a long message that contains `Hello from Docker!`.

## 3. Run a ubuntu contianer inside ubuntu (?)

Keep reading [DigitalOcean Docker Guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) step 5.

With that done we should go litte deeper into docker and run a ubuntu container inside our ubuntu server.
[<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IypeKl9NJhPFMrK/giphy.gif" alt="What!?" width="20%">](https://gph.is/2o1bMgY)

To do this find a ubuntu image on dockerhub. [Hint!](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/).

[Pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) this down and [run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) it with a `-it` [flag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground).

s:

Pull:

    $ docker pull ubuntu

Run it:

    $ docker run -it ubuntu

You should now see a new bash terminal and this is from inside your running ubuntu container. If you look inside this container you will se that it is a totaly empty ubuntu installation. And if you install something inside this container and you restart the container it would be empty again.

You can exit the container with `exit` command.

But how can I install something insida a container that will constantly be there?

## 4. Create a Dockerfile

That is why we need Dockerfiles. A Dockerfile is a instruction file that Docker uses to create a image with all of our new settings that we have added inside the Dockerfile and this is when it becomse really interesting.

Before we start to create a new Dockerfile you should list all images that is pulled to your server.
You can do this by running:

    $ docker image ls

So your new task should be to [build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) your own custom [image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image/) with a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact) and inside this image it should have a program called `htop`. By default the ubuntu image dosen't have this application.

Create a file with nano called `Dockerfile`.

    $  nano Dockerfile

Add this content to the file:

      FROM ubuntu:16.04

      #Update image
      RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y

      #Install htop
      RUN apt-get -y install htop

      #Set working directiv to conatiner
      WORKDIR /app/yrgo

      #Run a bash loop and log output to logfile.log
      CMD exec /bin/sh -c 'trap : TERM INT; (x=1; while true; do echo "Welcome to container. Loop: $x" > logfile.log; sleep 5; x=$(( $x + 1 )); done) & wait'

## 5. Build a image

Then we should build our new image from our Dockerfile, we will call our new image `kalleanka/loop`.

**Note** that it is a good practice to name new image to `yourname/scriptname` and when you run the build command don't forget the dot in the end.

    $ docker build -t kalleanka/loop .

If you list all Docker images then you will see your new image

    $ docker image ls

## 5. Run your new image.

Now we have build our new image and we are ready to run it. To run this container in the background we add a `-d` flag.

    $ docker run -d kalleanka/loop

Check that your new container is running by typing:

    $ docker ps

If you can see a container that has IMAGE named `kalleanka/loop` you have successfully build and started a own Docker container.

## 6. Inspect container

Now when you have started a running conatiner, you should be able to login to it and inspect it. Do do this you have to have the `CONTAINER ID` of this conatiner and you get it by list all docker processes.

    $ docker ps

And then get the `CONTAINER ID` and add it to:

    $ docker exec -it `CONTAINER ID` bash

You are now inside your container. You can now see the output from the loop that is running with:

    $ cat logfile.log

And open `htop`, the application we installd inside the Dockerfile, by typing `htop`.
Exit `htop` by pressing `F10`

## 7. Stop and delete runing conatiner

Before we are complete with this lession we should learn to stop our running container and remove them.

To stop conatiner:

    $ docker stop `CONTAINER ID`

To remove conatiner:

    $ docker rm `CONTAINER ID`
